            <p>“For some, the solution is to destroy the thermometer in order to hide the fever.  To assassinate a journalist, 
              to silence a defender of rights and freedom — will  that change the political situation?  It is clear today that 
              only those critical voices might allow the ruling party to appreciate its proximity to the precipice toward which 
              its leaders rush headlong, dragging with it the entire country.  Only those critical voices might allow the ruling 
              party to save itself from collective seppuku.  And they called him Cassandra.”
